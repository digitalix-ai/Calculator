# Calculator
A simple calculator program I wrote to exercise my basic Python skills

On start, the program provides short instructions. The user is prompted to choose consequtively a first number, an arithmetic operator,
and a second number. If the values entered differ from appropriate symbols, respectively integers for the numbers and '+', '-', '*' or
'/' for the arithmetic operator, the program informs the user about the correct type of symbols and prompts back for a new selection.
When all the values are entered correctly, after pressing Enter the result is displayed at the bottom. The result is an integer for all
operations, apart from division, for which it is a floating point number.
